# Hi, I'm David 👋

**Customer Success Leader | EMEA Builder | AI-First Operator**

I've spent 10+ years building and scaling enterprise Customer Success organisations across EMEA — most recently at Salesforce/Tableau, where I was a founding member of the EMEA CS function and grew the team from 3 to 40+ across 7 countries.

I'm now focused on bringing that scaling playbook to high-growth AI companies expanding into European markets.

### What I'm working on

🤖 **AI-First CS Operations** — Designing frameworks that put AI at the core of customer engagement, not bolted on as an afterthought. See my [ai-first-customer-success](https://github.com/DavLMZ/ai-first-customer-success) repo for practical frameworks, prompt templates, and playbooks.

🎓 **Continuous Learning** — Y Combinator Startup School · Anthropic Academy · Imperial College VC Programme · PRINCE2 Agile

### By the numbers

- **$54.5M** enterprise portfolio managed
- **113%** renewal target achievement
- **40+** CSMs hired, coached, and developed
- **7** countries across EMEA
- **96.7%** peak renewal rate
